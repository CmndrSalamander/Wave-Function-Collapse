## Using Recursiving Backtracking

  - Initially, the solution was restarting the program when the WFC (Wave Function Collapse Algorithm) ran into a situation where a non-collapsed cell had zero options. A much better solution would look back and check where a different decision could have been made to avoid the zero-option state.
  - I implement this by saving a path of grid states in sequential order. When a zero-option state is reached, the program resets to the previous state and eliminates the decision which caused the zero-option state. The program then continues as normal until the next zero-option state is reached.
  - But suppose the decision which led to the zero-option state was actually made 5 steps ago. This can be solved by recursively performing depth first search until the current state has returned back to where the wrong decision was made. Here is my implemetation:

```javascript
                                                            // The pick is the current randomly chosen option which a cell will collapse into
if (pick === undefined) {                                   // Checking if the current state is a zero-option state
  grid = path[path.length - 2][0];                          // Sets current grid to previous state
  prevCell = path[path.length - 2][1];                      // Saves the previous cell which was randomly chosen
  prevPick = path[path.length - 2][2];                      // Saves the previous pick
  prevCell.options.pop(prevCell.options.indexOf(prevPick)); //Removes the previous pick from the previous cell's available options
  prevCell.collapsed = false;                               // Uncollapses the previous cell
  path.splice(path.length - 2);                             // Prunes the zero-option state from the path
  return;                                                   // Runs the program again from the beginning
}
```

## Other Changes
  - Changed the way edges are labelled to always follow right-to-left and top-to-bottom
  - Added presets for a green border and a central chip
  - Visually represented the entropy of each cell using colors (Green -> low entropy, Red -> High Entropy)
