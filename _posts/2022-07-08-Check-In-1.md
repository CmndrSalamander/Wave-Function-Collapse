## Increasing Modularity

  - The goal of this check in is to separate the algorithm from the tiles.
  - In other words, I wanted to increase modularity by allowing my main algorithm to work seamlessly with many sets of tiles, each with their own unique edges and restrictions.
  - I achieved this by creating a tile.js for every tile set which holds the edges and restrictions of the tile set.

Here is the basic tile.js template I used for all the tile sets:
```javascript
const tileImages = [];
const numTiles = ???;

function preload();                             // Loads all the tiles in the tile set (I made sure all the names were 0.png - ?.png)


edges = [['???', '???', '???', '???'],          // All the edge data for every tile
         ['???', '???', '???', '???'], 
         ['???', '???', '???', '???'], ... ];

restrictions = [[0,  [???]],                    // Additional restrictions between tiles which could connect otherwise
                [1,  [???, ???]], 
                [2,  [???, ???, ???]], ...];

function reverseString(s);

function compareEdge(a, b);

class Tile {
  constructor();                                // Javascript doesn't allow for multiple constructors so this is my janky solution
  
  static indexCon(i);                           // Generates new Tile given the tile index
  
  static allCon(img, edges, i);                 // Generates new Tile given the tile index, image, and edges


  analyze(tiles);                               // Generates options from edge and restriction data

  rotate(num, w, h);                            // Rotates tiles by changing image and edges
  
  static getTiles();                            // Acts as a tile factory so that the main algorithm only recieves an array
                                                // with all the tiles ready to go
}
```

## Other Changes
  - Used blue to represent a cell which has one option but is not yet collapsed
  - Fixed bugs with recursive backtrack
  - Created a better (but slower) method for removing duplicate tiles, still doesn't work for some (Curse you 10.png)
  - Added keyboard controls to help debug (Esc -> pause, Ctrl -> Resume, Left Arrow -> Previous State, Right Arrow -> Next State)

## Next Steps
  - Implement probabilistic weights for tiles
  - Sudoku Solver
