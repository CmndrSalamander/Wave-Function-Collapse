## Sudoku Solver Complete

  - Using my Waveform Function Collapse Algorithm, I implemented a sudoku solver which works for for any <i>n</i>^2 by <i>n</i>^2 sudoku board (Where <i>n</i> is a natural number)
  - To test the efficiency, I let my program run for about 100,000 steps total for the 4x4 and 9x9 sudoku boards
  - Unfortunately, increasing the number of tiles from 16 to 81 increased the average steps from 16.24 to 580.24 and the max steps from 27 to 17556 (yikes!)
  - This is still much more effiencient than simply recursively backtracking through all the possibilities of the sudoku board


Will add the interactive sudoku solver when I figure out how to

## Next Steps
  - Implement probabilistic weights for tiles
  - Figure out other applications for the Wave Function Collapse Algorithm
