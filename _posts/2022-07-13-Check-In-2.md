## Sudoku Solver Complete

  - Using my Waveform Function Collapse Algorithm, I implemented a sudoku solver which works for for any <i>n</i>^2 by <i>n</i>^2 sudoku board (Where <i>n</i> is a natural number)
  - To test the efficiency, I let my program run for about 100,000 steps total for the 4x4 and 9x9 sudoku boards
  - Unfortunately, increasing the number of tiles from 16 to 81 increased the average steps from 16.24 to 580.24 and the max steps from 27 to 17556 (yikes!)
  - A standard recursive sudoku solver tries all variations of a given board and returns the one's that work
  - This program solves sudoku puzzles in a way more similar to a human (using logic to eliminate possibilities + checking tiles with the least number of options first)

Will add the interactive sudoku solver when I figure out how to

{% include p5js-widget.html width=400 height=400 %}
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
  circle(200, 200, 300);
}
</script>

## Next Steps
  - Implement probabilistic weights for tiles
  - Figure out other applications for the Wave Function Collapse Algorithm
